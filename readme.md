# nahsh-gtfs-rt-server

**Poll the [nah.SH](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nahverkehrsverbund_Schleswig-Holstein) [HAFAS endpoint](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client/tree/5/p/nahsh) to provide a [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://gtfs.org/reference/realtime/v2/) feed for Schleswig-Holstein & Hamburg.**

This project uses [`hafas-client`](https://github.com/public-transport/hafas-client) & [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed) to fetch live data about all vehicles in the Schleswig-Holstein & Hamburg bounding box and build a live [GTFS Realtime (GTFS-RT)](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs-realtime/) feed from them.


## Installing & running

*Note*: [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed), the library used by this project for convert for building the GTFS-RT feed, has more extensive docs. For brevity and to avoid duplication (with e.g. [`hamburg-gtfs-rt-server`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hamburg-gtfs-rt-server)), the following instructions just cover the basics.

### Prerequisites

`nahsh-gtfs-rt-server` needs access to a [Redis](https://redis.io/) server, you can configure a custom host/port by setting the `REDIS_URL` environment variable.

It also needs access to a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) 12+ server; Pass custom [`PG*` environment variables](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-envars.html) if you run PostgreSQL in an unusual configuration.

It also needs access to a [NATS Streaming](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-concepts/intro) server (just follow its [setup guide](https://docs.nats.io/nats-streaming-server/run)); Set the `NATS_STREAMING_URL` environment variable if you run it in an unusual configuration.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/derhuerst/nahsh-gtfs-rt-server.git
cd nahsh-gtfs-rt-server
npm install
```

### Building the matching index

```shell
npm run build
```

The build script will download [the latest nah.SH GTFS Static data](#todo) and import it into PostgreSQL. Then, it will add [additional lookup tables to match realtime data with GTFS Static data](https://github.com/derhuerst/match-gtfs-rt-to-gtfs). [`psql`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) will need to have access to your database.

### Running

Specify the bounding box to be observed as JSON:

```shell
export BBOX='{"north": todo, "west": todo, "south": todo, "east": todo}'
```

`nahsh-gtfs-rt-server` uses [`hafas-gtfs-rt-feed`](https://github.com/derhuerst/hafas-gtfs-rt-feed) underneath, which is split into three parts: polling the HAFAS endpoint (`monitor-hafas` CLI), matching realtime data (`match-with-gtfs` CLI), and serving a GTFS-RT feed (`serve-as-gtfs-rt` CLI). You can run all three at once using the `start.sh` wrapper script:

```shell
./start.sh
```

In production, run all three using a tool like [`systemctl`](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-systemctl-to-manage-systemd-services-and-units), [`forever`](https://github.com/foreversd/forever#readme) or [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) that restarts them when they crash.

### via Docker

A Docker image [is available as `derhuerst/nahsh-gtfs-rt-server`](https://hub.docker.com/r/derhuerst/nahsh-gtfs-rt-server).

*Note:* The Docker image *does not* contain Redis, PostgreSQL & NATS. You need to configure access to them using the environment variables documented above (e.g. `NATS_STREAMING_URL`).

```shell
export BBOX='{"north": todo, "west": todo, "south": todo, "east": todo}'
# build the matching index
docker run -e BBOX -i -t --rm derhuerst/nahsh-gtfs-rt-server ./build.sh
# run
docker run -e BBOX -i -t --rm derhuerst/nahsh-gtfs-rt-server
```

### inspecting the feed
